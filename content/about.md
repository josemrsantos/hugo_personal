# Personal
I am Portuguese and like photography, board games and nature walks. I also have a beautiful wife and daughter.

# Professional
Software engineer since 2002, I have worked on all sort of projects, but mostly in Data Engineering and data related 
projects. But my love for computers and software started much early, 
when I was 11 Years old and got a ZXSpectrum 48K where games came in "music tapes" and would load in 3 to 5 minutes. 
It was on that computer that I started playing with basic. 

Fast-forward a few Years, I went to do my "secondary 
education" (10th to 12th years) on a school that had a "professional" option on software development that I did, 
followed by a 5-Year B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering at the New University of Lisbon (www.fct.unl.pt)

I started doing volunteer work on my first Year at Uni, with a project that aimed at getting more information for 
students on the Internet. I also started having several paid jobs from the second Year on, that lasted until I left 
Lisbon and Portugal for London and the UK in the start of January 2015.

Over my career I have created or helped create several DataWarehouses, a data lake and any required tool for Analytics.

I have fine-tuned (both for performance and cost wise) Redshift and other AWS tools. Used
devOps to deploy solutions based on Docker running locally and on ECS and AWS Batch.

Implemented engineering best practices (code reviews, testing, security, deployment,
documentation). I have helped hire and mentored great talent.

I have designed and implemented both in 3NF (for online services) and star/snowflake schemas
(Kimball/dimensional modelling for Analytics).

Outside tech, I have also been part of a “Culture crew” . I also created a “board game at lunch”
group that got together in a friendly way with people from all parts of the company.

I always strive to "get the job done", in collaboration with my co-workers and stakeholders. 

I am usually quite quick to learn new technologies and concepts that I don't yet know.
