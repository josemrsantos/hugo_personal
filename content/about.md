# Personal
I am Portuguese and like photography, board games and nature walks. I also have a beautiful wife and daughter.

# Professional
Software engineer since 2000, I have worked on all sort of projects, but mostly in Data Engineering and data related 
projects. But my love for computers and software started much early, 
when I was 11 Years old and got a ZXSpectrum 48K where games came in "music tapes" and would load in 3 to 5 minutes. 
It was on that computer that I started playing with basic. 

Fast-forward a few Years, I went to do my "secondary 
education" (10th to 12th years) on a school that had a "professional" option on software development that I did, 
followed by a 5-Year B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering at the New University of Lisbon (www.fct.unl.pt)

I started doing volunteer work on my first Year at Uni, with a project that aimed at getting more information for 
students on the Internet. I also started having several paid jobs from the second Year on, that lasted until I left 
Lisbon and Portugal for London and the UK in the start of January 2015.

Outside tech, I also created a “board game at lunch” group that got together in a friendly way with 
people from all parts of the company (Worldremit at the time).

I always strive to "get the job done", in collaboration with my co-workers and stakeholders. 

I am usually quite quick to learn new technologies and concepts that I don't yet know.
