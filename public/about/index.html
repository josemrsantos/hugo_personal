<p>Software engineer since 2002, I have worked on all sort of projects, but mostly in Data Engineering and data related
projects. But my love for computers and software started much early,
when I was 11 Years old and got a ZXSpectrum 48K where games came in &ldquo;music tapes&rdquo; and would load in 3 to 5 minutes.
It was on that computer that I started playing with basic.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few Years, I went to do my &ldquo;secondary
education&rdquo; (10th to 12th years) on a school that had a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; option on software development that I did,
followed by a 5-Year B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering at the New University of Lisbon (<a href="http://www.fct.unl.pt"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.fct.unl.pt</a>)</p>
<p>I started doing volunteer work on my first Year at Uni, with a project that aimed at getting more information for
students on the Internet. I also started having several paid jobs from the second Year on, that lasted until I left
Lisbon and Portugal for London and the UK in the start of January 2015.</p>
<p>Over my career I have created or helped create several DataWarehouses, a data lake and any required tool for Analytics.</p>
<p>I have fine-tuned (both for performance and cost wise) Redshift and other AWS tools. Used
devOps to deploy solutions based on Docker running locally and on ECS and AWS Batch.</p>
<p>Implemented engineering best practices (code reviews, testing, security, deployment,
documentation). I have helped hire and mentored great talent.</p>
<p>I have designed and implemented both in 3NF (for online services) and star/snowflake schemas
(Kimball/dimensional modelling for Analytics).</p>
<p>Outside tech, I have also been part of a “Culture crew” . I also created a “board game at lunch”
group that got together in a friendly way with people from all parts of the company.</p>
<p>I always strive to &ldquo;get the job done&rdquo;, in collaboration with my co-workers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>I am usually quite quick to learn new technologies and concepts that I don&rsquo;t yet know.</p>
